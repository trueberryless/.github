# Default Community Health Files

This repository contains the default community health files for all repositories under [@trueberryless](https://github.com/trueberryless).

## Overview

These files serve as the default community health files for all my repositories that don't have their own specific files. They help maintain consistency across all projects and provide essential guidelines for contributors.

## Files Included

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: Guidelines for participation in my projects
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Instructions for contributing to my projects
- `SECURITY.md`: Security policies and reporting procedures
- `FUNDING.yml`: Sponsorship options
- `LICENSE`: License information for my projects

## How These Files Work

1. These files will be used as defaults for any repository that doesn't have its own version
2. Individual repositories can override these defaults by adding their own files
3. Changes to this repository will affect all repositories that use these defaults

## Contact

For questions about these files, please open an issue in this repository.

## Updates

I regularly review and update these files. Watch this repository to stay informed about changes.
